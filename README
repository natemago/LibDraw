LibDraw is JavaScript/HTML5 graphics and animation library.
Please see the [Introduction]: (https://github.com/natemago/libdraw/wiki/Introduction) to libDraw for more detailed information on the version 2 (0.2) of this library.

However, the third edition of the library (version 0.3) brings a lot of new changes (the library has been rewritten from scratch) and new exciting features.
You can keep track with the latest development by checking out the **v03devel** branch.
